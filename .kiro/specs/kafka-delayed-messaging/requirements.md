# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a Kafka-based delayed messaging system similar to RabbitMQ delayed queues. The system uses separate delay topics for different delay durations (e.g., delay-5s, delay-10s) where all messages in a topic have the same delay timeout. Applications produce messages to the appropriate delay topic with metadata in headers specifying the target topic. Delay consumers process these messages and republish them to their target topics after the specified delay. 

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to delay message processing when operations fail, so that I can implement retry logic with configurable delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an application needs to delay a message THEN the system SHALL route it to the appropriate delay topic based on delay duration
2. WHEN delay topics are created THEN the system SHALL use naming convention like "delay-5s", "delay-10s" for different durations
3. WHEN a message is produced to delay topic THEN the system SHALL store target topic name in Kafka message headers
4. WHEN a message is produced to delay topic THEN the system SHALL store the exact processing time (timestamp) in Kafka message headers
5. WHEN a message is produced to delay topic THEN the system SHALL use JSON format for message payload
6. WHEN delay precision is specified THEN the system SHALL support millisecond-level precision
7. WHEN messages are in the same delay topic THEN all messages SHALL have the same delay timeout

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want delayed messages to be processed automatically, so that messages are delivered to their target topics at the correct time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a delay consumer starts THEN the system SHALL continuously consume from its assigned delay topic
2. WHEN a delay consumer receives a message THEN the system SHALL read the exact processing time from message headers
3. WHEN a delayed message is ready for delivery THEN the system SHALL publish it to the target topic specified in headers
4. WHEN a delayed message is not ready THEN the system SHALL sleep until the delivery time
5. WHEN message delivery time arrives THEN the system SHALL publish the message within millisecond precision

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle failures gracefully, so that errors are logged and don't crash the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs during message processing THEN the system SHALL log the exception details
2. WHEN a critical error occurs THEN the system SHALL fail fast and log the error
3. WHEN message headers are malformed THEN the system SHALL log an error and skip the message
4. WHEN target topic is unreachable THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing other messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use modern .NET frameworks, so that the application benefits from latest performance and security improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL target .NET 8 or .NET 9 framework
2. WHEN Kafka operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use Confluent.Kafka client library
3. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL leverage modern .NET features and performance optimizations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the delay system to be scalable, so that multiple instances can process delayed messages efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple delay consumers run THEN the system SHALL distribute message processing across instances
2. WHEN consumer instances scale up or down THEN the system SHALL automatically rebalance message processing
3. WHEN high message volume occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain processing performance
4. WHEN the system operates THEN it SHALL NOT require persistent state storage

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily integrate delayed messaging into existing applications, so that I can add retry logic with minimal code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating the delay system THEN the application SHALL provide simple producer methods for delayed messages
2. WHEN producing delayed messages THEN the system SHALL accept delay duration and target topic as parameters
3. WHEN HTTP calls fail THEN the application SHALL demonstrate retry with configurable delays
4. WHEN messages are delayed THEN all delay information SHALL be contained in message headers only
